# CS 100 Programming Project
## Project Proposal
### Group Members
Elbert Nguyen, enguy054@ucr.edu  
Franz Ignacio, figna002@ucr.edu  
Ken Lee, klee229@ucr.edu  
### Project title
SimpleCalc will be the title of our project.
### What application do you plan to work on?
Our group plans to work on a basic four-function calculator.
### Why is it important and interesting?
This project will be interesting, as we believe something so inherently simple as a four-function calculator is going to be challenging to code while implementing the design patterns introduced in this course. This project is important, as it allows us to demonstrate the similarity between how a computer copmutes a mathematical expression and a human performing the same computation.
### What language/tools/technology do you plan on using?
We will be coding this calculator in C++.
### Input/output of the project?
- Input: Two numbers and a choice of computation (addition/subtraction/division/multiplicaton)
- Output: The result from the computation
