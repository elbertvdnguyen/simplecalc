Description for Decorator Pattern:
This Pattern is optimized for adding additional functionality to our existing calculator. 
Our existing calculator is able to perform standard operations on user provided operands. 
Using a getEvaluate() function, we are able to get the result. 
With an abstract AdditionalFeatures component, we are able to add conversions into the mix. 
We can convert the answer into Radians or convert the answer into Degrees.

Description for Strategy Pattern:
This pattern is created to get the very basic objects and algorithms for our existing calculator working.
Our existing calculator after implementing the strategy pattern will be able to do the following functions:
Multiply, Divide, Add, Subtract, Power, and Modulo. 
Alongside that, we will have an abstract evaluate component so that we can implement more functions if needed.
